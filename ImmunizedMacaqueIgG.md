# Mutational antigenic profiling of purified IgG from immunized macaques

Adam S. Dingens, Jesse D. Bloom, In collaboration with Chris Cottrell and Andrew Ward

We are performing mutational antigenic profiling of sera from macaques vaccinated with BG505 trimers, using the BG505.T332N mutant Env libraries, first described and characterized in [Haddox, Dingens et al 2018](https://elifesciences.org/articles/34420). In some cases, the trimer has 241 or 289 holes glycosylated and the RM19R, a non-NAb targeting the highly immunodominant peptidic epitope on the exposed base of the trimer, was pre-incubated with trimer to mask this epitope. Note that the RM19R epitope is not present on live virus used in mutational antigenic profiling.

Note that this is only the first set of data; most data is from single replicates, while few are averaged across two replicates (33311, CG41).
